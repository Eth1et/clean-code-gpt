<div id="outer" class="smooth-shadow-large">
    <mat-card>
        <mat-card-header>
            <mat-card-title>
                404 Not Found
            </mat-card-title>
        </mat-card-header>
    </mat-card>
</div>
```

There's no further room for refactoring in this snippet as it only contains a simple structure for displaying a `404 Not Found` message within a card component. If this snippet were a part of a larger project, one could consider separating repetitive HTML blocks into components or using templating to improve maintainability.
