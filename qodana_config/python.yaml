I apologize for the oversight. You're correct that clean code encompasses more than just SOLID principles, and the initial example may not cover all aspects adequately. Creating a comprehensive set of clean code inspections can be quite challenging, but I'll provide a more elaborate example that includes a variety of clean code practices:

yaml
Copy code
inspections:
  - name: "Clean Code Practices"
    description: "Check adherence to clean code principles"
    enabled: true
    patterns:
      - name: "Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)"
        target:
          file:
            extension: "py"
        code:
          matches: "class [^:]+:"
          not_contains:
            - "__init__"
          lines: "> 100"
      - name: "Meaningful Names"
        target:
          file:
            extension: "py"
        code:
          matches: "^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]{2,30}$"
      - name: "Function Length"
        target:
          file:
            extension: "py"
        code:
          matches: "def [^_]+\(.*\):"
          lines: "> 20"
      - name: "Unused Variables"
        target:
          file:
            extension: "py"
        code:
          matches: "^[^#]*\b(?:var|let|const|def|class)\s+(\w+)"
          occurrences: "< 2"
